My implementation of a simple disruptor queue based on the LMAX disruptor queue outlined [here](https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/disruptor.html).

Future improvements
- Batch reading / writing
- More support for different types / in place construction
- Different yeilding / blocking mechanisms
- Unit tests
- Benchmarks
